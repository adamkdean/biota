# Biota

"Biota" is a series of experiments aimed at simulating basic life forms using machine learning techniques. The project seeks to explore the possibilities of creating artificial life forms and understanding the fundamental principles of living systems. The repository contains code and documentation for different simulations, including genetic algorithms, neural networks, and other ML models. The project is open-source and welcomes contributions and collaborations.

## Current status

Client-side connects to server-side via WebSockets. Server-side simulates very basic lifecycle of objects, sending them to the client-side for rendering. The client-side renders the objects using HTML5 Canvas using a simple 2D renderer.
